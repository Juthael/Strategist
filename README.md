# Strategist
Maps every minimal list of optimization criteria ordered by priority to an optimal strategy.

A strategy is encoded as a vector of ranks : if the third value of a given strategy is 2, then this strategy is the 2nd most compliant to the third criterion. 

The string inputs are a list of criterion names, and a list of strategies.
